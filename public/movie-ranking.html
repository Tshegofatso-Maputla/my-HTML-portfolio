<h1>The Best Movies According to Tshegofatso</h1>

<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Bring It On!</h3>

<p>I recommend this movie because
it highlights the art and creativity when it comes to cheerleading,
and embracing your unque individuality and identity in your cheers.</p>

<h3>Turning Red</h3>

<p>I love this movie because it speaks about being proud of the changes, that not only comes with age but being confident
in yourself,even if it means embracing your silly and weird side.</p>

<h3>The Princess and the Frog</h3>

<p>I love this movie because it encourages me that with hard work and determination,
you can have what you desire; you should never allow your background, history or other people's opinion about you,
stop you from achieving your goals.
It also highlights the importance of not being narrow minded or too focused on your dreams 
that you ignore the blessings around you that you miss your big dream hidden in everyday endervours.</p>
